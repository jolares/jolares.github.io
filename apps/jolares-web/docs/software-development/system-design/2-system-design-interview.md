# System Design Interview

<!--
Best practices that we should follow during a system design interview:

1. Solidify requirements
    - ask the right questions
2. Scope the problem
    - So you are able to make a good attempt at solving it within the limited time frame of the interview. SDIs are usually about 35 to 40 minutes long
3. Engage with the interviewer
    - A critical step. Do not silently work on the design, instead, engage with the interviewer to ensure that they understand your thought process.


## Present the high-level design

High level design uses _high level components_ and describe how they fit together.

Example _high level_ components:
- Users
- Frontend
- Load Balancer
- Caches
- Data Storage
- Data Processing
- Etc...

High level components are often represented as boxes, with arrows between them
representing which component talks to which other component, and how the
components fit together as a group.


## Vertical Slicing & Motivation

It’s commonly believed in the systems community that when some aspect of the system increases by a factor of ten or more, the same design might not hold and might require change.

Designing and operating a bigger system requires careful thinking because designs often don’t linearly scale with increasing demands on the system.

Another question in an SDI might be related to why we don’t design a system that’s already capable of handling more work than necessary or predicted.

****The answer** is that the dollar cost associated with complex projects is a major reason why we don’t do that.

whatever we do as System Designers have implications for the business and its customers. We need to meet or exceed customer needs by efficiently utilizing resources -->
