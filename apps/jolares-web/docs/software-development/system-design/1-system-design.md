# System Design

<!--
System Design is a process. It is the process of defining
the components and integrations of software systems in order to meet
specific functional and non-functional requirements.

Computer networking
parallel computing
distributed systems

Design systems that scale well and are performant; specifically, it has the goal
of designing systems that are reliable, effective, and maintainable.

- A reliable system gracefully handles faults, failures, errors.
- An effective system meets the end-user needs as well as the product requirements.
- A maintainable system is flexible to evolve (i.e. add new features and/or remove existing ones).

System design seeks guarantees around system scalability, availability, maintainability, consistency, and fault-tolerance
- scale with increasing users
- remain available even under different faults
- meet the product functional goals with good performance

Real-world system design is combined with software development, which we recommend takling as an iterative process that starts with a reasonably good design, followed a measure of how it performs, and then improving the design in the next iteration. There are tradeoffs along the way to be considered.


## System Design challenges

Things will change, and things will break over time because of the following:

Thereâ€™s no single correct approach or solution to a design problem.
A lot is predicated on the assumptions we make.

# Responsibility of the system designer

As designers, we need to provide fault tolerance at the design level because almost all modern systems use off-the-shelf components, and there are millions of such components. So, something will always be breaking down, and we need to hide this undesirable reality from our customers.
