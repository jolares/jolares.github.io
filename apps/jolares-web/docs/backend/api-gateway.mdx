// TODO: Improve/Complete this analogy
Analogy: an API Gateway is like an Amazon Returns Center. When the mailman picks up
your outgoing return mail, he/she/they do not take it directly to the recipient's 
address, despite the item you are returning  having the right address written on it. Instead,
the mailman takes it to the post-office, and this letter is then take it to the post-office
